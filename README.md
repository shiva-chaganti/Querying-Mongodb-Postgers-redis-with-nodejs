HEROKU:

--> The external datasource used in this project is Players.csv that includes the soccer players statistics.

--> The Heroku toolbelt commands to execute the scripts: 

	1) git add .  
	2) git commit -m “statement”
	3) git push Heroku master
	4) heroku run bash
	5) node filename.js

--> The querying part which is done in node.js server side framework seems to be easy as node js helped with its useful libraries or modules that were available for simplifying the querying part.

--> Creating and navigating to Heroku directories, executing the scripts using Heroku Tool belt showed me up a difficult part.
